- 👋 Hi, I'm Fabián, but you can call me Fabo or Hayden. I'm 21 y/o and my pronouns are He/They.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about my future jobs, develop my first programs as a programmer and, somehow, make the world better.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Programming, but I'm on a quest to dominate as much things as possible.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on translating text from English to Spanish and vice versa, also code some programs and web pages.
